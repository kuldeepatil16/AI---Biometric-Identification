# AI - Biometric-Identification -  Fingerprint recognition systems
We use MATLAB code.

Fingerprints Features extraction using MATLAB.
Fingerprints Core point detection using MATLAB.
Fingerprint matching using MATLAB Code.
Calculating distance between all combination of fingerprints - In fingerprint recognition systems, features are often represented using polar coordinates, where r is the radial distance and Î¸ is the angular direction.
